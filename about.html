            I would like to personally thank<br> you for visiting this website. <br>It's a bit of a passion project <br> for me for two reasons.
            First, I <br> am very passionate about volunteer<br> work. So, the fact that you're<br> on this website means you're<br> interested in helping your<br> community, and that makes<br> incredibly happy! 
            Congratulations<br> on taking your first step<br> towards helping your fellow humans!<br> I hope you find a good fit<br> for yourself here.
            <br><br>Second, this website is actually the<br> first real project I've taken on <br>as a web designer! It's been nice<br> to put my skills to the test,<br> and make something a bit more<br> complete than your typical<br> coding exercises.
            Keep doing your best<br> to improve the lives of the<br> people around you, and<br> always remember that we're<br> all, at our core, just human<br> beings.
            <br><br>~Amanda

          <h4>A Message from Jerry</h4>
          <p>
            Hello all! Thank you<br> for stopping<br> by. We built this organization<br> with the dream that it will<br> inspire others like ourselves to<br> volunteer more.
            <br>It's a tough world out there,<br> and we need as many people<br> as we can to spread kindness<br> and make this world a<br> more welcoming place.
            <br>So, thanks for being here.<br> I hope you find a charity<br> that's a good fit for you,<br> and I hope you go out there<br> and change some lives.
            <br><br> ~Jerry

            <p>HelpHub™ was founded in 2022 by two college students, Amanda Ackerman and Jerry Caviston. The two had spent their early years always wanting to do more volunteer work for their communities, but never knew exactly how to start.
              The two decided to solve this problem for themselves and the other members of their community. Together, the two decided to create a platform for everyday heroes who want to help their communities so they could find charities who need their help.
              HelpHub™ was born from the hearts of these two people, but continues to grow and expand. As more charities join us, and more volunteers like you contact those charities, we can begin to truly make a difference together.
